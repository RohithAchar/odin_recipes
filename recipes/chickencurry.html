    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless chicken</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Curry powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes soft and lightly golden, which usually takes about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pan and sauté for another 2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and start to break down, typically for about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the curry powder and cook for a couple of minutes to release its flavors.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are no longer pink on the outside, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add a little water (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup) to create a curry sauce. Stir well to combine, and then cover the pan. Let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and tender. If the curry gets too dry, you can add more water.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt as needed.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken curry hot with rice or flatbread.</li>
    </ol>
